        Hello. My name is Jörn Zaefferer.<br>
        I'd like to tell you about making websites accessible.<br>
        Specifically about making websites accessible to people with low vision or blindness.<br>
        Put another way:

        That's after I've put my glasses on. Without them, it might have looked like this [blur 2, actually take glasses off]<br>
        Glasses help in my case, but it might be worse, like this [blur 4].<br>
        At that point, glasses probably don't help anymore.<br>
        It might still be worth [blur 5]. There's a blob of light, but this is probably considered legally blind.<br>
        The odds are good that you don't know someone personally who's blind. The percentage is low, but the absolute numbers aren't.

        This is comparable to a screenreader. Its only purpose is to tell you how to drive from point A to point B.<br>

        So, no headers. Usually headers are pretty useful for navigation.<br>
        "edit text" is the search input here, but its not labelled, so the screenreader can't tell us the purpose of that input<br>
        This site was supposed to work for specifically for screenreader users. Most regular sites are even worse.

        Keyboard testing is manual, but really easy to do.<br>

        It can find unclosed elements, duplicate ids or invalid nesting.<br>

        The validator makes them easy to spot.<br>
        <!-- To automate validation, you could use grunt-html. -->

        Keyboard testing uncovers a lot of the issues screenreader users would also have to deal with, but can be done with very little effort on any site, at any time.<br>
        Just put away your mouse (or ignore your touchpad).<br>
        Use tab key for basic navigation<br>
        Try to interact with all interactive elements<br>
        Let's check out an example of that.

        This video shows the Wizzair site, an airline. I'm looking for a flight, using only the keyboard.<br>
        You can see which buttons I'm pressing at the bottom, mostly using the Tab key.<br>
        [play video, narrate a bit]<br>
        Search works, but selecting the actual flight fails as can't focus that area (at least there's no visual focus).<br>
        So what's the issue here? Let's look at the markup of that first button.

  <slide class="full nobackground">
    <aside class="note">
      <section>
        We can see that the button is an anchor element, but without an href attribute.<br>
        There's probably JavaScript attached to it, doing something on click.<br>
        But without the attribute, the anchor can't receive focus, because the browser doesn't consider this an interactive element.<br>
        So we can't trigger that click event with the keyboard.<br>
        A screenreader user would also have to deal with this issue. How can we fix that?

        Its really pretty trivial.<br>
        We can add a placeholder href attribute to an anchor. And we can make a span focusable by adding the tabindex attribute<br>
        Even better would to use an actual button element for a button, and an actual anchor for links.<br>
        We can still add custom behavior with JavaScript, but starting with proper markup is essential.<br>
        Let's check out two more examples of bad markup...

        The product title here should really be a header.<br>
        The product image needs an alt attribute with a useful description.<br>
        The decoration image needs an alt attribute with an empty value. That tells screenreaders to ignore this image.<br>
        Do this whenever there is no description for an image. Don't skip the alt attribute, otherwise the screenreader reads the image filename. Which usually sounds pretty terrible.<br>

        Link labels to inputs using the for-attribute. Otherwise a screenreader won't know how to label the input. We've seen that happening on the amazon site as well, where we heard "edit text", but not "search edit text".<br>

      VoiceOver on iOS uses the touchscreen for input, making the interaction a lot more spatial and two-dimensional.<br>
      To give you a better idea what that means, check out this video from Tommy Edison, The Blind Film Critic:<br>
      [show video]<br>
      For testing VoiceOver on iPhone you need an actual device, since its not supported in the simulator.<br>
      So for the following examples, I'll use VoiceOver on OSX.

        All desktop screenreaders have something in common, and while they use different names, I'll just call it "Virtual Cursor".<br>
        The virtual cursor is one way of navigating documents and the primary way to read documents.<br>
        It basically allows you to walk through the DOM tree, reading one element after the other.<br>
        Let me show you a short example of using the virtual cursor.

        screenreaders also support going directly to certain elements<br>

        We've can fix this by making the overlay and confirmation elements live regions<br>
        That is done simply by adding the aria-live attribute.<br>

        Whenever we change the text of a live region, the content is announced by the screenreader<br>

        With the live region in place, VoiceOver actually announces both changes.<br>
        For the overlay, the "subscribing" text isn't visible, but the screenreader reads it anyway, since that is more useful then, say, reading "loading indicator".<br>
