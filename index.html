        Using the W3C is still useful. Not to put a "W3C Validated" badge on your site, but to look for actual problems.<br>
        Find unclosed elements, duplicate ids or invalid nesting is really easy with the validator.<br>
        And usually those issues don't have a visual effect, but can badly mess with screenreaders.

        Keyboard testing uncovers a lot of the issues screenreader users would also have to deal with, but can be done with very little effort on any site, at any time.
        <ul>
          <li>Just put away your mouse (or ignore your touchpad).</li>
          <li>Use tab key for basic navigation</li>
          <li>Try to interact with all interactive elements</li>
        </ul>
        Let's check out an example of that.

        This video shows the Wizzair site, an airline. I'm looking for a flight, using only the keyboard.<br>
        You can see which buttons I'm pressing at the bottom, mostly using the Tab key.<br>
        [play video, narrate a bit]<br>
        Search works, but selecting the actual flight fails as can't focus that area (at least there's no visual focus).<br>
        So what's the issue here? Let's look at the markup of that first button.

        We can see that the button is an anchor ("a") element, without a href attribute.<br>
        Without the attribute, the anchor can't receive focus, as the browser doesn't consider this an interactive element.<br>
        A screenreader user would also have to deal with this issue, so how can we fix that?

        Its really pretty trivial.<br>
        We can add a placeholder href attribute to an anchor.<br>
        And we can make a span focusable by adding the tabindex="0"<br>
        Better yet though, we use an actual button element for a button, and an actual anchor for links.<br>
        We can still layer behavior we JavaScript on top, but starting with proper markup is essential.<br>
        Let's check out two more examples of bad markup...

        This one is from the first screenreader example I showed you.<br>
        The product title should really be a header.<br>
        The product image needs an alt attribute with a useful description.<br>
        The decoration image needs an alt attribute with an empty value. That tells screenreaders to ignore this image.<br>
        Do this whenever there is no description for an image. Don't skip out the alt attribute.

        I found this table on another airline site. Don't do that.<br>
        Link labels to inputs using the for-attribute. Otherwise a screenreader won't know description to read for the input. We've seen that happening on the amazon site as well.

        We already covered a lot of issues, using different cheap techniques.<br>

        You should start with NVDA+Firefox on Windows. That’s free to use, easy to install and has a pretty decent marketshare.<br>
        With a Mac available, you should enable VoiceOver in System Preferences and check with Safari (no need to install anything; no other browser works properly with VoiceOver).<br>
        JAWS has the biggest market share, you can test the demo version for 40 minutes before having to restart your computer. In that regard, NVDA is a lot cheaper.<br>
        Also worth mentioning is VoiceOver on iOS. Its very different from the OSX version. You should test with it especially if you’re building a mobile focused site.

        Let’s look at at a few examples:
        Testing for screeenreader accessiblity. Brief explanation, with example, of heading navigation ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUPhEVWu_E - “screenreaders don’t read style, they only read markup” ) and virtual cursor. Google search, H to jump to sponsored links, then results, then cursor down to read description.
        how fast screenreader users set their readers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92pM6hJG6Wo (first 30s)
        Show iOS/VoiceOver demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0nvdiRdehw (the part where he reads Twitter and posts a tweet)
        For testing NVDA and JAWS, you need Windows. If you’re on Linux or OSX, using a VM works. You can even get good Windows VMs from the modern.IE project.

      <h2>TODO Screenreader Testing Examples</h2>

      TODO: where to start? Demo first, then explain virtual cursor, then another example? Or explain virtual cursor first?
      Also don't bother with the iOS example, since that doesn't even show a web browser. Ignore iOS or do a browser demo (needs actual iPhone, simulator doesn't work).<br>
      How about this: Demo site that works, e.g. Google Search. Then explain virtual cursor. Then show bad example, which can be captured with previous testing methods. Then show screenreader specific issue and explain how ARIA helps solve that. Starting with ARIA basics, then jQuery UI examples and implementation.

        Once you’ve got a screenreader running, which is at most a matter of running the installer and then starting the installed application, you need to know a little bit about navigation with a screenreader. Unlike your previous keyboard accessibility testing, screenreader users don’t use the Tab key as much. Instead they use other methods of navigation. Pretty much all of those have shortcuts mapped to single keys, so for example in JAWS you press H to go to the next header. There’s another shortcut to go through links (anchors). You can also use the cursor keys to move your virtual cursor. Starting from a header, cursor down will move the virtual cursor to the next element, so for example the screenreader would then read the text of the paragraph below a header. Let’s see how that works by looking at this video of me navigating Google Search with NVDA: [video]

        Yep, ARIA can be pretty terrible. Back to our &gt;span> link, we can use role=”link” to tell the screenreader what we’re pretending here. It gets a little more complicated though.

        Generally its a good idea to use a framework that is already tested against screenreaders and makes use of the right ARIA roles and other attributes. One such framework is jQuery UI. Its no coincidence that I’m working on jQuery UI and giving this talk, since I’ve spent a good amount of time making jQuery UI widget’s accessible, including a lot of screenreader testing.

        We know that there are people with disabilities benefiting from technology. We’ve gathered arguments for convincing our bosses, clients and coworkers to value web accessbility. We’ve seen how to test basic keyboard access as well as screenreaders. We’ve looked at solutions for fixing the problems we find, by hand or using frameworks that are already accessible. I hope I could convince you that making web sites accessible is worth it.
