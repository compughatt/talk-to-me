        Sadly, a lot of the internet isn't accessible.<br>
        On the bright side, a lot of the existing issues are pretty easy to fix.<br>

        I'd like you to listen to this recording. Its the recording of browsing a website with a screenreader. Screenreaders literally read what sighted people can see on the screen. Please listen to this and try to figure out what is going on.

        So, no headers. Usually headers are pretty useful for navigation.<br>
        "edit text" is the search input here, but its not labelled, so the screenreader can't tell us the purpose of that input<br>
        the search result page has no headers either. Instead if has a "New and used" link for each listing, which isn't particularly useful<br>
        After pressing enter on the link, VoiceOver started reading "page has", but then just stopped. I don't know why.<br>
        This image has no description, so VO just reads the filename.<br>
        This site is supposed to work for screenreaders. Most regular sites are much worse.

        Using the W3C is still useful. Not to put a "W3C Validated" badge on your site, but to look for actual problems.<br>
        Find unclosed elements, duplicate ids or invalid nesting is really easy with the validator.<br>
        And usually those issues don't have a visual effect, but can badly mess with screenreaders.

        Keyboard testing uncovers a lot of the issues screenreader users would also have to deal with, but can be done with very little effort on any site, at any time.
        <ul>
          <li>Just put away your mouse (or ignore your touchpad).</li>
          <li>Use tab key for basic navigation</li>
          <li>Try to interact with all interactive elements</li>
        </ul>
        Let's check out an example of that.

        This video shows the Wizzair site, an airline. I'm looking for a flight, using only the keyboard.<br>
        You can see which buttons I'm pressing at the bottom, mostly using the Tab key.<br>
        [play video, narrate a bit]<br>
        Search works, but selecting the actual flight fails as can't focus that area (at least there's no visual focus).<br>
        So what's the issue here? Let's look at the markup of that first button.

        We can see that the button is an anchor ("a") element, without a href attribute.<br>
        Without the attribute, the anchor can't receive focus, as the browser doesn't consider this an interactive element.<br>
        A screenreader user would also have to deal with this issue, so how can we fix that?

        Its really pretty trivial.<br>
        We can add a placeholder href attribute to an anchor.<br>
        And we can make a span focusable by adding the tabindex="0"<br>
        Better yet though, we use an actual button element for a button, and an actual anchor for links.<br>
        We can still layer behavior we JavaScript on top, but starting with proper markup is essential.<br>
        Let's check out two more examples of bad markup...

        This one is from the first screenreader example I showed you.<br>
        The product title should really be a header.<br>
        The product image needs an alt attribute with a useful description.<br>
        The decoration image needs an alt attribute with an empty value. That tells screenreaders to ignore this image.<br>
        Do this whenever there is no description for an image. Don't skip out the alt attribute.

        All desktop screenreaders have something in common, and while they use different names, I'll just call it "Virtual Cursor" for now.<br>
        The virtual cursor is one way of navigating documents and the primary way to read text nodes.<br>
        Its basically allows you to walk through the DOM tree, reading one element after the other.<br>
        Let me show you a short example of using the virtual cursor.
