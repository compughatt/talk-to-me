        Today, there are people with disabilities, and there’s technology that can help those people.<br>
        Some technology is useful for everyone, but even more so for people with disabilities.<br>
        Other technology is specifically designed for people with disabilities.<br>
        This talk is about the first category, but first I want to give you some examples from the second category and a general overview of disabilities.

        According to the US census, not counting childrens and seniors, there's almost 20 million people in the US with disabilities. That's 6% of the population.
        According to the german census bureau, again not counting children and seniors, there's 3.4 million people with disabilities, 4.1% of the population in Germany.
        Once you take seniors into account, the numbers are a lot higher though.
        Less developed countries also have higher rates of peoples with disabilities, though country specific numbers are hard to find.<br>
        Therefore, some worldwide and region specific numbers for particular disabilities:

        From a recent survey on mobile accessibility.<br>
        Of the 816 people that responded, 56% are blind.<br>
        In other words, if you are interested in mobile accessibility as a user, blindness is the most common issue.<br>
        The second highest percentage is Low vision with 15%. These could be people who can see, but also use a screenreader to assist them<br>
        Also worth noting is the Physical/Motor category, with 9.44%.<br>

        Austin is blind since birth, so this was the first time he could experience colors for himself.<br>
        Its also easy to imagine how this would be very useful for someone with Achromatopsia, a type of color blindness where the person sees only a mix of gray and brown.<br>

        I'd like you to listen to this recording. Its the recording of browsing a website with a screenreader.<br>
        Screenreaders literally read what sighted people can see on the screen.<br>
        Screenreaders try to make sense of all applications running on a computer, not just the browser.<br>

        So, no headers. Usually headers are pretty useful for navigation.<br>
        "edit text" is the search input here, but its not labelled, so the screenreader can't tell us the purpose of that input<br>
        the search result page has no headers either. Instead if has a "New and used" link for each listing, which isn't particularly useful<br>
        This image has no description, so VO just reads the filename.<br>
        This site is supposed to work for screenreaders. Most regular sites are much worse.

        There’s side effects: Making your site easier to use for disabled users is likely going to have an effect on everyone else as well. Keyboard support is useful for anyone who doesn’t want or can use the mouse, could be a disability or superusers.<br>
        Working with clean markup is good for screenreaders, but also has other benefits, for SEO or preview snippets (Twitter, Facebook?).

        Using the W3C is still useful. Not to put a "W3C Validated" badge on your site, but to look for actual problems.<br>
        Find unclosed elements, duplicate ids or invalid nesting is really easy with the validator.<br>
        And usually those issues don't have a visual effect, but can badly mess with screenreaders.

        Keyboard testing uncovers a lot of the issues screenreader users would also have to deal with, but can be done with very little effort on any site, at any time.
        <ul>
          <li>Just put away your mouse (or ignore your touchpad).</li>
          <li>Use tab key for basic navigation</li>
          <li>Try to interact with all interactive elements</li>

        This video shows the Wizzair site, an airline. I'm looking for a flight, using only the keyboard.<br>
        You can see which buttons I'm pressing at the bottom, mostly using the Tab key.<br>
        [play video, narrate a bit]<br>
        Search works, but selecting the actual flight fails as can't focus that area (at least there's no visual focus).<br>
        So what's the issue here? Let's look at the markup of that first button.

        We can see that the button is an anchor ("a") element, without a href attribute.<br>
        Without the attribute, the anchor can't receive focus, as the browser doesn't consider this an interactive element.<br>
        A screenreader user would also have to deal with this issue, so how can we fix that?

        Its really pretty trivial.<br>
        We can add a placeholder href attribute to an anchor.<br>
        And we can make a span focusable by adding the tabindex="0"<br>
        Better yet though, we use an actual button element for a button, and an actual anchor for links.<br>
        We can still layer behavior we JavaScript on top, but starting with proper markup is essential.<br>

        This one is from the first screenreader example I showed you.<br>
        The product title should really be a header.<br>
        The product image needs an alt attribute with a useful description.<br>
        The decoration image needs an alt attribute with an empty value. That tells screenreaders to ignore this image.<br>
        Do this whenever there is no description for an image. Don't skip out the alt attribute.

        With a Mac available, you should enable VoiceOver in System Preferences and check with Safari (no need to install anything; in theorey no other browser works properly with VoiceOver).<br>
        VoiceOver has all the drawbacks of OS-bundled software: Only updated when you update your OS. The VoiceOver version on Snow Leopard is terrible, for example you need at least Lion for landmark support.

      Very different is VoiceOver on iOS, which uses the touchscreen for input, making the interaction a lot more spatial and two-dimensional.<br>

        All desktop screenreaders have something in common, and while they use different names, I'll just call it "Virtual Cursor" for now.<br>
        The virtual cursor is one way of navigating documents and the primary way to read text nodes.<br>
        Its basically allows you to walk through the DOM tree, reading one element after the other.<br>
        Let me show you a short example of using the virtual cursor.

        What we've just used are attributes specified as ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications spec<br>
        The two major aspects that ARIA consists of are roles...<br>
        We've seen landmarks in action before, as well as role="status"<br>
        Other roles are widget specific, we'll take a look at those soon<br>
        ARIA also specifies varios sates and properties, usually a set of those apply per role<br>
        As any web standard, ARIA isn't without problems, so sometimes we have to use workarounds instead of just strictly following the spec to make things work<br>
        That's where a framework like jQuery UI can be super useful, since it implements the correct or necessary approach, and even has some leverage on fixing the bad implementations or specifications...

      <section>
        Here's some of the markup.<br>
        To make it readable, I've removed the class attributes that jQuery UI uses for theming.<br>
        As you saw on the screenshot, there's two top-level items, with a nested menu under the second.<br>
        Every element, except for the icon span, gets a role.
        <ul>
          <li>menu is used for the containers</li>
          <li>menuitem for the items itself</li>
          <li>presentation to indicate which elements don't have a meaning on their own</li>
        </ul>
        Let's see what that sounds like in a screenreader...

        [show video]
        For some reason the "right arrow" isn't shown, though I pressed it to open the submenu<br>
        (if anyone notices that VO doesn't announce "has popup": VO bug, works fine in NVDA?)<br>
        Let's look at the autocomplete widget as the second example...

        The markup here, excluding the menu, is pretty simple.<br>
        Autocomplete uses a live region to make it useful for screenreader users<br>
        This isn't what the spec says, but it works well, unlike the specified approach.<br>
        Let's listen to VoiceOver reading it...

        You can seem me typing a "j", then an "a".<br>
        Then, as suggested, I use the cursor keys to navigate the results.<br>

        We know that there are people with disabilities benefiting from technology.<br>
        We’ve gathered arguments for convincing our bosses, clients and coworkers to value web accessibility.<br>
        We’ve seen how to test basic keyboard access as well as screenreaders.<br>
        We’ve looked at solutions for fixing the problems we find, by hand or using frameworks that are already accessible.<br>
        I hope I could convince you that making web sites accessible is worth it.
