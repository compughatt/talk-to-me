## Usage

Adopted from [Google's IO 2012 slides](https://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/)

To regenerate CSS files, use

  compass watch

Open `template.html` from filesystem or local server.

### Presenter mode

The slides contain a presenter mode feature (beta) to view + control the slides
from a popup window.

To enable presenter mode, add `presentme=true` to the URL: [http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=true](http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=true)

To disable presenter mode, hit [http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=false](http://localhost:8000/template.html?presentme=false)

Presenter mode is sticky, so refreshing the page will persist your settings.
